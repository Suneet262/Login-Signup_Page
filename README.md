# Uniform_Inventory_Management_System

The Uniform Inventory Management System (UIMS) is a project aimed at improving the order-taking and monitoring process for manufacturers.
The existing manual practice of recording orders by hand in a ledger is prone to errors and inefficiencies. 
By developing an efficient interface, the UIMS streamlines the order management process, providing manufacturers with a modern solution to effectively handle their inventory.

# Technologies Used => 

User Interface: The UIMS features a web-based or desktop application interface for manufacturers to interact with the system. It provides an intuitive and visually appealing platform for order entry, monitoring, and inventory management.
Backend: The backend of the UIMS is built using server-side technologies like PHP, Python, or any other suitable language. It handles the processing of incoming requests, database interactions, and business logic implementation.
Database: The UIMS utilizes a database management system, such as MySQL or PostgreSQL, to store and manage order data, customer information, product details, and inventory records. The database ensures data integrity and supports efficient querying and retrieval.
